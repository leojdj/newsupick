# NewsUPick
A simple App that downloads news and saves favourite ones for later browsing.

The news are downloaded using customized filters so that people can keep up to date with the stuff that interests them, without getting overwhelmed.

The App is a PWA and uses JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to offer a cross-platform Mobile application experience as well as a responsive Web one.

Being a PWA, the App is device independent and its responsive nature allows it to adapt to a variety of screensizes and Smartphone models. It is also lightweight and does not require special hardware to work.

At the same time, it maintains the look and feel that most mobile applications offer these days.
